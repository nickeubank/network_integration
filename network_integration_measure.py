    Doc string!


    graph: graph object to be analyzed. 
    min_k: minimum number of steps to be considered (passed as `start` to 
           range)
    max_k: maximium number of steps to be considered (passed as `stop` to
           range, and thus NOT included itself)
    k_step:  Step size for k (passed as `step` to range).
    aggregation_func: function applied across nodes for each k to summarize. 
           By default, calculates mean of each nodes k-integration score. 
    debug: If True, prints lots of intermediate outcomes for review.

        Pandas Series where index is k for each value, and value is

        with a given k value.
